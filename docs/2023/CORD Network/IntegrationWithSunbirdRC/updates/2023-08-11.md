## Milestones

- [x] Using SunbirdRC's APIs

### Milestone 1 : Using Sunbird RC's APIs

Sunbird RC provides us with a set of autogenerated APIs which is one of the USP of this plaform. Now in order to use these APIs, most of the times we need to be authenticated, and in the previous week we have already made the keycloak setup,the authentication provider for Sunbird.

During this week, I worked on the schema creation APIs. [Links](https://docs.sunbirdrc.dev/api-reference/schema/create-schema)

Now, when we hit this endpoint, we need to make sure we are authorized. We will need to authenticate as the admin user we created previous week, along with the access token.

```bash
    http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/sunbird-rc/protocol/openid-connect/token

```

#### Backend Functions

``**Note``

``` bash 
    The endpoint we hit is /api/v1/Schema [POST]. However, in the backend, it is mapped to /api/v1/{entityName}.
```

```bash
   java/registry/src/main/java/dev/sunbirdrc/registry/controller/RegistryEntityController.java

   @RequestMapping(value = "/api/v1/{entityName}", method = RequestMethod.POST)
   
```

The above method listens for the create-schema, invite entity endpoint.

Following APIs were tested :
 
1. create schema - [POST]:api/v1/Schema
2. invite entity - [POST]:api/v1/{entity-type}/invite
3. get list of schemas : [GET]: api/v1/Schema
