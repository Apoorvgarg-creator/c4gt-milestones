## Milestones
- **Thorough Testing of Translations:** I initiated a comprehensive testing phase encompassing all translations completed up until week 3. During this meticulous review, I identified a previously missed component - the detailed notifications page - and promptly converted it to ensure consistent multilingual coverage.
- **Multilingual Generate Report Page:** Successfully introduced multilingual support for the Generate Report page. Both types of reports, Case Report, and Settlement Agreement, now offer translations for dropdowns, placeholders, and content, enhancing accessibility and comprehension.
- **Multilingual Annual Report Generation:** Extended multilingual capabilities to the Annual Report Generation page. Users can now generate annual reports in their preferred language, further promoting inclusivity and engagement.

## Learnings

- **Cross-Role Integration:**  Exploring both IC Member and employee components allowed for a better understanding of how different roles interact within the platform. This knowledge is valuable in ensuring that cross-role interactions are well-coordinated and effectively communicated.

- **Language Consistency:** Ensuring consistent language usage across all roles for similar components becomes particularly crucial in role-specific sections. Translations must align with the specific role's context and terminology for clear communication.
